## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medboughrara/Tortoise-Text-to-Speech.git
cd Tortoise-Text-to-Speech
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv tts_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\tts_env\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac:
source tts_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Voice Samples

1. Create `tortoise/voices` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Download voice samples from the [official Tortoise TTS voices repository](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts-voices)
3. Extract voice samples to `tortoise/voices` directory

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Web Interface

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The interface will be available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### Using the Interface

1. Enter your text in the text area
2. Choose a voice from the available options
3. Select a quality preset:
   - **Ultra Fast**: Quick results, lower quality
   - **Fast**: Good balance for shorter texts
   - **Standard**: Recommended for most uses
   - **High Quality**: Best results, slower generation
4. Click "Generate Speech" and wait for processing
5. Play the generated audio directly in browser
6. Download the audio file if desired

### Quality Presets Guide

| Preset | Speed | Quality | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Ultra Fast | ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è | ‚≠êÔ∏è | Quick testing |
| Fast | ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Short texts |
| Standard | ‚ö°Ô∏è | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | General use |
| High Quality | üê¢ | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Production |

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a Pull Request
- Enter your text, select a voice and preset, and click **Generate Speech**.

### Command-line Usage

Generate speech from the terminal:

```bash
python tortoise/do_tts.py --text "I'm going to speak this" --voice random --preset fast
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA/GPU Issues**
   - Ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU
   - Install latest NVIDIA drivers
   - Verify CUDA installation with `nvidia-smi`

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Try lower quality presets
   - Process shorter text segments
   - Close other GPU-intensive applications

3. **Voice Sample Issues**
   - Verify voice samples are in correct directory
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure file names match expected format

### Error Messages

- `CUDA out of memory`: Reduce batch size or text length
- `No module named 'torch'`: Reinstall PyTorch
- `Voice not found`: Check voice sample installation
